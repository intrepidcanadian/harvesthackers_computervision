**Introduction**

Stayed up until 4 am to continuously work on this 1.5 day hackathon project - super excited to share my technical build of combining computer vision with AI in the agricultural sector!

This was a hackathon hosted in Whitby, Ontario (1855 Accelerator) where I used AI models and computer vision to count product inventory, identify diseases, and check on the health of a cow through its poop. I also leveraged video (instead of just photos) and showcased how AI intel could be combined with some of the existing technologies (QR code, location, timestamp, etc.) to quickly act upon information identified by AI or translate classification information (i.e. tomatoes) for supply chain transparency.

This project was one of the winners so take a listen in the link above!

Thank you so much to the incredible contribution by volunteers, mentors, judges, and all stakeholders involved. I have to say that I felt blessed with the hospitality and sponsorship at this hackathon - we literally had mentors stopping by every few hours all the way into 11pm and volunteers on-site 24/7. Whitby's corporate community, local entrepreneurs, and the amazing hospitality really made us hackers feel welcome.

With Whitby being the place where I grew up as a child, I am definitely excited to see more start-ups and tech firms grow there.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
